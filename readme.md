### Security Considerations

- Download models only from trusted sources
- Verify file integrity when possible
- Keep the application updated
- Review model documentation for any specific considerations

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**Model Won't Load:**
- Verify the file is in GGUF format
- Check available RAM (model requirements vary)
- Ensure sufficient disk space
- Try a smaller quantized version

**Slow Performance:**
- Close other applications
- Use Q4_K_M quantization for faster inference
- Consider GPU acceleration if available
- Ensure models are stored on SSD

**Generation Stops Unexpectedly:**
- Check max tokens setting
- Verify model compatibility
- Restart the application
- Try different generation parameters
