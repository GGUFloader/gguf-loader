# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The GGUF Loader is a desktop application for running large language models (LLMs) locally on Windows, Linux, and macOS. It provides a user-friendly interface for loading GGUF format models, chatting with AI, and extending functionality through an addon system. The application prioritizes privacy, offline operation, and ease of use for both beginners and advanced users.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a user, I want to install and run the application with zero setup, so that I can start using local AI models immediately without technical configuration.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the user runs the application THEN the system SHALL automatically detect and configure required dependencies
2. WHEN the application starts for the first time THEN the system SHALL create necessary directories and configuration files automatically
3. WHEN the user launches the application THEN the system SHALL display a functional GUI within 10 seconds
4. WHEN the application encounters missing dependencies THEN the system SHALL attempt to install them automatically or provide clear error messages

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a user, I want to load GGUF model files through a simple interface, so that I can use different AI models for various tasks.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the user selects a GGUF model file THEN the system SHALL validate the file format and load it into memory
2. WHEN a model is successfully loaded THEN the system SHALL display model information and enable chat functionality
3. WHEN model loading fails THEN the system SHALL display specific error messages and suggested solutions
4. WHEN the user switches models THEN the system SHALL properly unload the previous model and load the new one
5. WHEN no model is loaded THEN the system SHALL disable chat functionality and display appropriate status messages

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a user, I want to have conversations with loaded AI models through a chat interface, so that I can interact with the AI naturally.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the user types a message and presses send THEN the system SHALL process the input and generate an AI response
2. WHEN generating responses THEN the system SHALL display real-time progress indicators
3. WHEN a conversation is active THEN the system SHALL maintain chat history and context
4. WHEN the user sends a new message THEN the system SHALL include previous conversation context in the AI prompt
5. WHEN response generation is complete THEN the system SHALL display the full response in a readable format
6. WHEN the user wants to start fresh THEN the system SHALL provide a clear chat option

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a user, I want to customize AI behavior through system prompts and generation parameters, so that I can tailor the AI responses to my specific needs.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the user accesses settings THEN the system SHALL provide options for system prompts, temperature, max tokens, and other generation parameters
2. WHEN the user selects a system prompt THEN the system SHALL apply it to subsequent AI interactions
3. WHEN the user adjusts generation parameters THEN the system SHALL validate the values and apply them immediately
4. WHEN the user wants bilingual support THEN the system SHALL provide Persian and English language options with appropriate prompts
5. WHEN the user saves settings THEN the system SHALL persist the configuration for future sessions

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to extend the application functionality through addons, so that I can add custom features without modifying the core application.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN an addon is placed in the addons directory THEN the system SHALL automatically discover and load it
2. WHEN an addon is loaded THEN the system SHALL call its register function and integrate it into the UI
3. WHEN an addon requires access to the loaded model THEN the system SHALL provide a secure API for model interaction
4. WHEN an addon encounters errors THEN the system SHALL handle them gracefully without crashing the main application
5. WHEN the user wants to manage addons THEN the system SHALL provide a sidebar interface for addon activation and control

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a user, I want a Smart Floating Assistant addon that works globally across all applications, so that I can process selected text with AI from anywhere on my system.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN text is selected in any application THEN the system SHALL detect the selection and show a floating button
2. WHEN the user clicks the floating button THEN the system SHALL display a popup with processing options
3. WHEN the user chooses to summarize or comment on text THEN the system SHALL process it using the loaded AI model
4. WHEN processing is complete THEN the system SHALL display results in the popup window
5. WHEN no text is selected THEN the system SHALL hide the floating button automatically
6. WHEN the addon is active THEN the system SHALL monitor text selection without impacting system performance

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a user, I want the application to work offline completely, so that I can use AI capabilities without internet connectivity or privacy concerns.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the application is running THEN the system SHALL function entirely offline without requiring internet access
2. WHEN processing text or generating responses THEN the system SHALL use only local model files and resources
3. WHEN the user's data is processed THEN the system SHALL ensure no data is transmitted to external servers
4. WHEN the application starts THEN the system SHALL not require online validation or authentication

### Requirement 8

**User Story:** As a user, I want the application to support multiple platforms, so that I can use it on Windows, Linux, and macOS.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the application runs on Windows THEN the system SHALL handle Windows-specific DLL loading and file paths
2. WHEN the application runs on Linux THEN the system SHALL properly configure library paths and dependencies
3. WHEN the application runs on macOS THEN the system SHALL handle macOS-specific library loading requirements
4. WHEN the application starts on any platform THEN the system SHALL detect the platform and configure accordingly
5. WHEN file operations are performed THEN the system SHALL use platform-appropriate path separators and conventions

### Requirement 9

**User Story:** As a user, I want comprehensive error handling and logging, so that I can troubleshoot issues and the application remains stable.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN errors occur THEN the system SHALL log detailed error information to log files
2. WHEN the application encounters recoverable errors THEN the system SHALL continue operation and notify the user appropriately
3. WHEN critical errors occur THEN the system SHALL fail gracefully and provide meaningful error messages
4. WHEN debugging is needed THEN the system SHALL provide configurable logging levels and detailed diagnostic information
5. WHEN the user reports issues THEN the system SHALL have sufficient logging to diagnose problems

### Requirement 10

**User Story:** As a user, I want the application to be easily installable and distributable, so that I can share it with others or deploy it in different environments.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the application is packaged THEN the system SHALL include all necessary dependencies and resources
2. WHEN the user installs via pip THEN the system SHALL install correctly with a single command
3. WHEN the application is distributed as an executable THEN the system SHALL run without requiring Python installation
4. WHEN the user wants to launch the application THEN the system SHALL provide multiple launch options (Python script, executable, batch files)
5. WHEN the application is deployed THEN the system SHALL automatically handle resource path resolution for different deployment scenarios
