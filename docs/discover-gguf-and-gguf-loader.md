# Discover GGUF and GGUF Loader: Run Local AI, ChatGPT-Style Assistants on Your PC

Are you looking for ways to use powerful AI models like **ChatGPT**, **GPT-4**, or other famous language models **locally on your computer** without needing the internet? You’re not alone. Many people want fast, private, and customizable AI assistants they can run offline.

This page introduces **GGUF**, a new AI model format, and **GGUF Loader**, a simple app to load and chat with local AI models — just like ChatGPT but running fully on your own PC.

## What Is Local AI and Why Does It Matter?

Local AI means running Large Language Models (LLMs) like GPT, ChatGPT, or other advanced models **directly on your hardware** — no cloud, no data leaks, no latency.

Benefits include:

- **Privacy:** Your data stays on your machine  
- **Speed:** Instant responses with no internet lag  
- **Control:** Customize and tweak models and tools freely  
- **Offline Use:** Work anywhere without needing Wi-Fi

GGUF (General Graph Unified Format) is an emerging, efficient model format designed to make local AI easier:

- It standardizes AI models so multiple tools can load them quickly
